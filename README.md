<h1>Hi, I'm Scrablocraft.</h1> 
<ul>
<li>I'm middle school student and I'm intrested in web development, in which I connect my feasible future job.</li> 
<li>So far I know the basics of HTML, CSS, python, java and C++.</li>
<li>Currently I learn Javascript and Django. I'm also doing my best to archieve something in informatic contests.</li>
<li>My current goals are to know as much as I can about Front- and Back-end development and general programing before I go to university and maybe win informatic olympiad of Poland.</li>
